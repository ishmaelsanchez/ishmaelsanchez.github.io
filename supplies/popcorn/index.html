<p><strong>Weaver Naks Pak Popcorn</strong> Higher yield popcorn that is more convenient to make. Pre-portioned packs include the kernels, salt, butter and oil. Gives you consistent popping that saves time and increases profits.</p>
<p><strong>Weaver Naks Pak Butter Burst Popcorn</strong> Lower saturated fat than the original Naks Pak. Uses Canola oil instead of Coconut oil. More of a buttery flavor.</p>
<p><strong>Weaver Gold </strong> The same high yield popcorn in the Naks Pak in a 50lb bag.<p>
<p><strong>Weaver Mammoth Mushroom</strong>Large kernels that expand to the highest volume. Used in large poppers to make kettle corn, caramel corn, and all other types of flavored popcorn. </p>
<p><strong>Magic Mushroom Popcorn</strong> B.K. Heuermann's exclusive popcorn is a type of mushroom corn that expands more to gain more product out of each bag which will increase your profit margin.</p>
<p><strong>Glaze Pop</strong> This is a Frosted Popcorn Mix that allows you to add different flavors to your popcorn without using a separate coating machine. You can coat your popcorn with this molten sugar glaze directly in the kettle as the popcorn pops. Glaze Pop contains a special ingredient which bonds sugar and oil together to guard against burning.
